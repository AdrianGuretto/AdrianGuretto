## 👋 Привет! What's up!

This is a place where I create, post, and then realize how much I can improve in my code, then do it all over again. I try to apply everything I have learned into real applications that will serve a purpose. By doing so, I share my path of improvement as well as contribute to the IT community.

* _🪖 Aspiring to become an IT-security specialist_

## About myself
I started my coding journey in February of 2022 with Python. Personally, I have made some significant advancements in my tech knowledge that I am proud of, but never satisfied. I believe that programmers are 21-century magicians (we would be described so by some ancient magicians) and I find it my greatest joy to create this "magic". C++ and backend overall for me seem to be the best ways to make something outstanding and outliving.
